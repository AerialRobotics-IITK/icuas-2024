## Install

You can either manually install the UAV software stack by following 
[uav_ros_simulation](https://github.com/larics/uav_ros_simulation) instructions or simply 
use Docker instead.

To install Docker on your system execute the following command:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/larics/uav_ros_simulation/main/installation/dependencies/docker.sh | bash
```

## Troubleshooting

Check out ```CHANGELOG.md``` for any new changes added to this project.

Feel free to use the [Discussions](https://github.com/larics/icuas23_competition/discussions) tab to exchange ideas and ask questions.

Consider opening an [Issue](https://github.com/larics/icuas23_competition/issues) if you have troubles with the simulation setup.

**NOTE** - If the challenge is not set up correctly it is (probably) not your fault! Components are subject to some changes during the competition so most problems should be solved by updating packages. Try following the troubleshooting recommendation. If the problem persists please post an issue.

### Update this package
In case there are new changes to the challenge repository:
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
catkin build
```

### Update Docker images
In case the Docker container simulation is not working correctly (e.g. an update happened):
```bash
git pull lmark1/uav_ros_simulation:[[DISTRO]]
```

In case the simulation inside the Docker container is (still) not working correctly:
```bash
./docker_build.sh --build-args "--no-cache --pull" --[[DISTRO]]
```

### Updating native installation
If you're building all the packages natively, navigate to the ```uav_ros_simulation``` folder and do the following:
```bash
git pull origin main
./installation/install.sh

# Navigate to catkin workspace (default is uav_ws)
catkin build
```

Update all code of the competition repo and build as follows:
```bash
git pull origin main
catkin build
```

## Build

You can either manually build all the packages on your system using the ```catkin build``` command.

Alternatively, to build the ICUAS2024 Competition solution image please execute the following command:
```
./docker_build.sh
```

Additional arguments:
* ```--focal``` - Build Docker image for Focal distro
* ```--focal-nogpu``` - Build Docker image for Focal distro (no dedicated graphics card)
* ```--build-args``` - Append additional Docker build arguments, e.g. --no-cache

## Startup

To automatically start and setup the challenge navigate to ```startup/challenge``` and run:
```
./start.sh
```
This should automatically setup and start the challenge, as well as run your code (see solution section in session.yml)

* Commands that run your challenge solution (rosrun, roslaunch etc.) should be placed in the ```session.yml``` file.
* Software configuration specific to the challenge should be placed in the ```custom_config``` folder.

**NOTE** If you are unfamiliar with the Docker or Tmux commands please check out this [quick-start guide](https://github.com/larics/uav_ros_simulation/blob/main/HOWTO.md).

**NOTE** If you choose to run the challenge inside the docker environment, please run the container first using:
```
./docker_run.sh
```

Additional arguments:
* ```--focal``` - Run Focal distro container
* ```--focal-nogpu``` - Run Focal distro container (no dedicated graphics card)
* ```--run-args``` - Append additional Docker run arguments, e.g. --rm

**NOTE** Keep in mind this will start a new container so any changes you make inside that container will be lost if you remove the container.
The idea of the container is to easily integrate your code with the challenge flight stack. To do so, please add your code directly to this ROS package since it is copied to the container. Furthermore, feel free to edit ```Dockerfile.focal``` or ```Dockerfile.bionic``` files to 
get all the resources and build your solution.

### Controlling the UAV

For your reference, we have set up trajectory planning using TOPP-RA, which you can use by publishing two topics:

* ```tracker/input_pose``` - Send a waypoint (PoseStamped) to TOPP-RA. TOPP-RA then interpolates trajectory between the current UAV pose and the target waypoint and sends trajectory points (MultiDOFJointTrajectoryPoint) to topic ```position_hold/trajectory``` with a given rate. The position controller of the UAV receives the trajectory point as a reference and commands the motors. 
* ```tracker/input_trajectory``` - Generate a trajectory using the given sampled path in the form of waypoints (MultiDOFJointTrajectory). TOPP-RA then interpolates trajectory from the current UAV pose to the first point of the trajectory and interpolates trajectory between sampled path points. Once the trajectory is interpolated, each trajectory point is sent as a reference to the position controller via the ```position_hold/trajectory``` topic

To control the UAV directly, and to publish the trajectory that you generated via your solution, you need to use the following topic:
* ```position_hold/trajectory``` - Publish a trajectory point directly to the UAV position control

Current position reference (the last one sent to the position controller of the UAV) can be obtained via ```carrot/pose``` topic, while the current pose of the UAV (in simulation) is available at ```mavros/global_position/local``` topic.

### Configuration

Configuration files are placed in the ```startup/challenge/custom_config``` folder.

* [Position Control](startup/challenge/custom_config/position_control_custom.yaml)
* [TOPP Trajectory Generation](startup/challenge/custom_config/topp_config_custom.yaml)


### Plant beds, plants, and fruits

The goal of the UAV is to count the total number of fruits of a given plant. The list of beds that the UAV needs to visit will be provided on the topic ```plant_beds``` within the UAV namespace. The message is a string (```std_msgs/String```) and contains the name of the plant and beds that need to be visited (eg. ```Pepper 1 2 8 12 19```), separated by whitespace. The number of beds may vary in a given mission.

Plants are simulated via textures on flat surfaces. The fruits of one variety of plants have the same color and shape and are simulated as 3D objects partially visible from either one or both sides of the plant. The shapes and colors of fruits on different variety of plants are different. There are three plant varieties: a) Tomato (red), b) Pepper (yellow), and c) Eggplant (purple). 

## Challenge

More details on the challenge can be found in the competition rulebook. After the UAV and the world is spawned, plants will also be spawned in beds. One plant bed can contain up to three plants. Each plant may have a different number of fruits (including zero). Some plant beds in the world may be empty, but the ones listed in the mission specification through the ```plant_beds``` topic will have at least one plant.

The setup in this repo reflects how the world for evaluation will be constructed. Teams are welcome to make a permanent world for testing and development since spawning of a large number of plants in Gazebo takes some time. 


### Important node for running your code
Remember that you should run your code alongside the existing setup through the session file. Use the existing solution section. You can use either existing waits to spawn your nodes or set your nodes to listen to the following topic:

* ```challenge_started``` - After ```True``` is published on this topic the UAV is set up correctly.
* ```plant_beds``` - After the array of points of interest is published on this topic the arena is set up correctly.

Make sure to wait for data on both topics to safely run your code.

### Changing the plant locations for testing
You can change plant locations through the session file or spawn them from a separate terminal. Use position args to change the location of the plant.
